## 2024-05-22 - [Hidden Interactive Elements]
**Learning:** Interactive elements like the "Remove File" button in `FileCard` were completely hidden (`opacity-0`) until hover, making them inaccessible to keyboard users and confusing for touch users.
**Action:** Ensure all interactive elements have a visible focus state (`focus:opacity-100`) and are accessible via keyboard, even if they are hidden by default for aesthetic reasons.
